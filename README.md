 *          The first thing to show up in the program is a calculator menu. The menu has
 *					nine options to choose from. Enter values, add, subtract, multiply, divide,
 *					average, maximum value, an option to determine whether each value entered is
 *					positive, negative or zero, and a quit option.
 *					The program presents the menu and requests for an input from the user.
 *					If the user enters an input that is not prompted in the menu then
 *					an error message will pop-up informing the user that they had entered an
 *					invalid entry. The program allows the user to try again. For a few of the
 *					options the user cannot select them without first selecting "Enter Values".
 *					If the user tries to do so without entering the values then an error message
 *					will pop up saying that they have not entered any values. The user can chose
 *					as they please until they select 'Q' for quit. After doing so they will be
 *					thanked for using the application.
